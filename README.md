Welcome to Refactoring from Anemic Domain Model Towards a Rich One
=====================

This is the source code for my Pluralsight course [Refactoring from Anemic Domain Model Towards a Rich One][L5].

How to Get Started
--------------

There are 2 versions of the source code: Before and After. You can go ahead and look at the After version but I would recommend that you follow the course and do all refactoring steps along with me.

In order to run the application, you need to create a database and change the connection string in the composition root.
